Build a Prometheus and Grafana monitoring system for a Kubernetes cluster.

Here are the user stories based on the configuration steps:

User Story 1:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to install the Prometheus Operator into the Kubernetes Cluster so that I can manage the Prometheus deployment effectively.

User Story 2:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure RBAC permissions for Prometheus so that it has the necessary access rights to perform its operations within the Kubernetes Cluster.

User Story 3:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy Prometheus into the Cluster using the Operator so that I can ensure it's correctly set up and ready to start monitoring.

User Story 4:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to expose the Prometheus server as a service so that it can be accessed from outside the Kubernetes Cluster.

User Story 5:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to create a ServiceMonitor so that it can track the status of Prometheus and alert me if anything goes wrong.



Estimation of time for completion of tasks can vary based on the specific skill sets of the engineer, their familiarity with the tools involved, and the complexity of the specific environment they're working in. However, here's a rough estimate for each of the user stories:

User Story 1: Installing the Prometheus Operator into the Kubernetes Cluster - If the engineer is comfortable with Kubernetes, this might take around half a day. If they are less familiar, it might take a full day.

User Story 2: Configuring RBAC permissions for Prometheus - This is a task that requires careful attention to detail. For an engineer with some experience, it might take half a day, but it could take a full day if they need to familiarize themselves with the RBAC permissions in Kubernetes.

User Story 3: Deploying Prometheus into the Cluster using the Operator - This could take around half a day, although it could take longer if unexpected issues arise.

User Story 4: Exposing the Prometheus server as a service - Assuming that the engineer is familiar with Kubernetes services, this could take around half a day.

User Story 5: Creating a ServiceMonitor - This depends on the engineer's familiarity with Prometheus Operator and ServiceMonitor. If they're comfortable with it, it might take half a day, but it could take a full day if they need to learn more about it.

So, in total, assuming some level of familiarity with Kubernetes and Prometheus, these tasks might take around 3 to 5 days for an engineer with 2 years of experience.

The tasks to build a Prometheus and Grafana monitoring system for a Kubernetes cluster have been broken down into the following user stories, along with their estimated completion times for an engineer with 2 years of experience:

1. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to install the Prometheus Operator into the Kubernetes Cluster.
   Estimated Completion Time: 0.5-1 day

2. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure RBAC permissions for Prometheus.
   Estimated Completion Time: 0.5-1 day

3. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy Prometheus into the Cluster using the Operator.
   Estimated Completion Time: 0.5 day

4. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to expose the Prometheus server as a service.
   Estimated Completion Time: 0.5 day

5. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to create a ServiceMonitor.
   Estimated Completion Time: 0.5-1 day

In total, these tasks might take around 3 to 5 days for an engineer with 2 years of experience.



[software architect]

Based on the user stories, the architectural design can be broken down as follows:

1. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to install the Prometheus Operator into the Kubernetes Cluster.
   - Architectural Design: The Kubernetes cluster should have a Node for the Prometheus Operator. The Prometheus Operator serves as the foundation for deploying Prometheus in the Kubernetes cluster. It is a Kubernetes native operator which can create, configure, and manage Prometheus clusters atop Kubernetes.

2. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure RBAC permissions for Prometheus.
   - Architectural Design: Prometheus will be set up with the necessary RBAC permissions in the Kubernetes cluster. This includes creating a ServiceAccount for Prometheus, and binding it to a Role or ClusterRole with the necessary permissions.

3. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy Prometheus into the Cluster using the Operator.
   - Architectural Design: Prometheus will be deployed into the Kubernetes cluster using the Prometheus Operator. The Prometheus instance will be run in its own Pod within the cluster. The Prometheus Operator will manage the configuration and updates of this Prometheus instance.

4. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to expose the Prometheus server as a service.
   - Architectural Design: The Prometheus server will be exposed as a Kubernetes Service. This Service will be used to access the Prometheus API and user interface. 

5. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to create a ServiceMonitor.
   - Architectural Design: A ServiceMonitor will be created to monitor the Prometheus Service. This ServiceMonitor will be managed by the Prometheus Operator, and it will configure the Prometheus instance to scrape metrics from the Prometheus Service.

In summary, the architecture involves a Kubernetes cluster with a Node for the Prometheus Operator, Prometheus instance running in a Pod, Prometheus exposed as a Service, and a ServiceMonitor monitoring the Prometheus Service. The Prometheus Operator manages the configuration and updates of the Prometheus instance and the ServiceMonitor.



[software engineer]

Based on the architectural design, I will create appropriate code snippets and explain the code. We'll use Kubernetes YAML configuration files for all our setup.

1. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to install the Prometheus Operator into the Kubernetes Cluster.
   - Code:
```yaml
# operator.yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: operators
spec:
  channel: beta
  name: prometheus
  source: operatorhubio-catalog
  sourceNamespace: olm
```
   - Explanation: This YAML file creates a Subscription to the Prometheus Operator in the 'operators' namespace. The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) will use this Subscription to install the Prometheus Operator.

2. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure RBAC permissions for Prometheus.
   - Code:
```yaml
# rbac.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: prometheus
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["nodes", "nodes/proxy", "services", "endpoints", "pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: prometheus
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: prometheus
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
```
   - Explanation: This YAML file creates a ServiceAccount for Prometheus and assigns it a ClusterRole with permissions to 'get', 'list', and 'watch' several types of resources in the cluster.

3. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy Prometheus into the Cluster using the Operator.
   - Code:
```yaml
# prometheus.yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  serviceMonitorSelector: {}
```
   - Explanation: This YAML file creates a Prometheus instance in the 'monitoring' namespace. It uses the 'prometheus' ServiceAccount and will automatically discover any ServiceMonitors.

4. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to expose the Prometheus server as a service.
   - Code:
```yaml
# service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - name: web
      port: 9090
      targetPort: web
  selector:
    prometheus: prometheus
```
   - Explanation: This YAML file creates a Service that exposes the Prometheus server on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort).

5. User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to create a ServiceMonitor.
   - Code:
```yaml
# servicemonitor.yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      prometheus: prometheus
  endpoints:
  - port: web
```
   - Explanation: This YAML file creates a ServiceMonitor that selects the Prometheus service and monitors the 'web' port.

Note: The YAML files should be applied in the order they are listed here. Use `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml` to apply each file.
